Question:
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Answer:
Fork: A kind of cloning but it only happens on Github Servers - from one user repository to another user-repository. Github keeps track of on how often a repository has been cloned. Use it to copy exitisting repositories on Github to your own

Clone: Branching a remote repository to a local machine. The remote repository becomes the "origin" (git remote -v) the new local repository is a new master branch by default

Branching: Creating a new version of an existing repository (git branch <NAME>) on the local machine. Use it to create a new feature branch or to create a new branch with experimental code.
